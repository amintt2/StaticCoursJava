# Java OOP Course - Static HTML Page

This project contains a static HTML page (`cours.html`) that presents a course on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Java.

## Content

The course covers fundamental OOP principles, including:
*   Introduction to OOP
*   Classes and Objects
*   Encapsulation
*   Object Communication (passing objects as parameters)
*   Methods returning objects
*   Method Overloading
*   Strings in Java (Immutability, comparison, `toString()`)
*   Constants (`final`)
*   Static Members (`static` variables and methods)
*   Inheritance (`extends`, `super`, `protected`, `final` classes)

## Structure

The course is presented as a single, self-contained HTML file (`cours.html`). It uses Tailwind CSS for styling and includes syntax highlighting for Java code examples. A navigation sidebar allows easy access to different sections of the course.

## How to View

Simply open the `cours.html` file in any modern web browser. No server or special setup is required.
